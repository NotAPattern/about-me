# About
I have a Bachelor degree at Omsk State University, speciality: "Mathematics and CS".

Now I'm studying for a master's degree at the Omsk State University in math faculty. 

Love Windows 10 Mobile, like Windows Phone 8(8.1), Spotify. Hate Microsoft (without negative).

I'm currently studying Rust, in the future study Erlang/Elixir.

I dream of getting a job in Yandex.

Now just let me adjust the spacial controls
And we'll move to another observation point"
